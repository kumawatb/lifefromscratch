# Life from Scratch {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

Provide an overview of the problem and a literature review. You should address: what gap or question are you addressing? What has been done before?

## Methods

### Model Description

Describe how your model works in terms of its: agents, interactions, environment, model schedule/timing

- It’s a good idea to use the PARTE and ODD frameworks as a guide
- Flow charts & visuals are good! Illustrate the sequence of events in your model using a flow chart. Show how the agents operate, how and when interactions happen, the sequence of events in each time step, etc.
- From your model description, someone should be able to implement a version of your model

### Model Analyses
Describe the parameter settings you swept through and the analyses you ran. Someone should be able to recreate your analyses from your description, so be specific and complete!

- If your model is stochastic, you may need to run multiple trials at the same parameter settings.

## Results
Provide qualitative and quantitative summaries of how your model behaves. Provide graphs and plots of model outcomes at different settings as needed.

## Discussion

Return to the question or problem in your introduction—what do your results say about this problem? Put your results in a broader context. Describe the strengths, limitations, and potential future directions of your work.

- If you think there are still some bugs driving your model’s behavior, this is the place to discuss this
- Also a good place to talk about how you might verify, validate, or extend the model in the future
