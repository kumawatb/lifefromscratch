  abstract     = {To distinguish continuous from discontinuous evolutionary
                  change, a relation of nearness between phenotypes is needed.
                  Such a relation is based on the probability of one phenotype
                  being accessible from another through changes in the genotype.
                  This nearness relation is exemplified by calculating the shape
                  neighborhood of a transfer RNA secondary structure and
                  provides a characterization of discontinuous shape
                  transformations in RNA. The simulation of replicating and
                  mutating RNA populations under selection shows that sudden
                  adaptive progress coincides mostly, but not always, with
                  discontinuous shape transformations. The nature of these
                  transformations illuminates the key role of neutral genetic
                  drift in their realization.},

                  suggested to be capable of self-replication and rudimentary
                  chemical evolution. Previous models for the behavior of such
                  sets have analyzed the global properties of short biopolymer
                  ensembles by using graph theory and a mean field approach. In
                  parallel, experimental studies with the autocatalytic
                  formation of amphiphilic assemblies (e.g., lipid vesicles or
                  micelles) demonstrated self-replication properties resembling
                  those of living cells. Combining these approaches, we analyze
                  here the kinetic behavior of small heterogeneous assemblies of
                  spontaneously aggregating molecules, of the type that could
                  form readily under prebiotic conditions. A statistical
                  formalism for mutual rate enhancement is used to numerically
                  simulate the detailed chemical kinetics within such
                  assemblies. We demonstrate that a straightforward set of
                  assumptions about kinetically enhanced recruitment of simple
                  amphiphilic molecules, as well as about the spontaneous growth
                  and splitting of assemblies, results in a complex population
                  behavior. The assemblies manifest a significant degree of
                  homeostasis, resembling the previously predicted
                  quasi-stationary states of biopolymer ensembles (Dyson, F. J.
                  (1982) J. Mol. Evol. 18, 344-350). Such emergent
                  catalysis-driven, compositionally biased entities may be
                  viewed as having rudimentary "compositional genomes." Our
                  analysis addresses the question of how mutually catalytic
                  metabolic networks, devoid of sequence-based biopolymers,
                  could exhibit transfer of chemical information and might
                  undergo selection and evolution. This computed behavior may
                  constitute a demonstration of natural selection in populations
                  of molecules without genetic apparatus, suggesting a pathway
                  from random molecular assemblies to a minimal protocell.},

  abstract     = {A basic property of life is its capacity to experience
                  Darwinian evolution. The replicator concept is at the core of
                  genetics-first theories of the origin of life, which suggest
                  that self-replicating oligonucleotides or their similar
                  ancestors may have been the first "living" systems and may
                  have led to the evolution of an RNA world. But problems with
                  the nonenzymatic synthesis of biopolymers and the origin of
                  template replication have spurred the alternative
                  metabolism-first scenario, where self-reproducing and evolving
                  proto-metabolic networks are assumed to have predated
                  self-replicating genes. Recent theoretical work shows that
                  "compositional genomes" (i.e., the counts of different
                  molecular species in an assembly) are able to propagate
                  compositional information and can provide a setup on which
                  natural selection acts. Accordingly, if we stick to the notion
                  of replicator as an entity that passes on its structure
                  largely intact in successive replications, those
                  macromolecular aggregates could be dubbed "ensemble
                  replicators" (composomes) and quite different from the more
                  familiar genes and memes. In sharp contrast with
                  template-dependent replication dynamics, we demonstrate here
                  that replication of compositional information is so inaccurate
                  that fitter compositional genomes cannot be maintained by
                  selection and, therefore, the system lacks evolvability (i.e.,
                  it cannot substantially depart from the asymptotic
                  steady-state solution already built-in in the dynamical
                  equations). We conclude that this fundamental limitation of
                  ensemble replicators cautions against metabolism-first
                  theories of the origin of life, although ancient metabolic
                  systems could have provided a stable habitat within which
                  polymer replicators later evolved.},

                  environment, consisting of replicators that produce

                  is twofold: first, to demonstrate the survival of
                  extracellular replicators despite the presence of
                  faster-replicating parasites; second, to observe the evolution
                  of adaptively useful enzymes. Accomplishing these goals will
                  underpin future attempts to attain open-ended and/or creative
                  evolution in the Squirm3 environment. The first aim is
                  achieved by attaching enzymes to their replicators. Our
                  software implementation demonstrates replicators with 10 bases
                  prospering in the presence of parasites with zero bases. To
                  accomplish the second aim, a process for creating selection

                  and subsequent dominance of a replicator that produces an
                  adaptively useful enzyme is demonstrated experimentally.
                  Finally, we comment on the crucial role played by neutral
