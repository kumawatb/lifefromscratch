From the micro-level processes (i.e. interactions between agents, agents and the environment, etc.), what macro-level, overall emergent dynamics are you interested in examining?\nIf you wish, you may also include a discussion here of any design concepts from the ODD protocol that you are interested in addressing.",

    "section": "Model",
    "text": "Model\nGive a brief overall description of the structure of your model, with a 1-2 sentence overview of the type of model your are using, the general types of agents you are considering, the environment, and how you plan to implement time.\nModel diagram: Include an overall model diagram illustrating the general structure of your model, as well as a flowchart illustrating how the model processes will run at each time step.*\n\n1) Environment\nGive an overall description of the environment in your model. Things to address if they apply:\n\nBoundary conditions (e.g. wrapping, infinite, etc.)\nDimensionality (e.g. 1D, 2D, etc.) or type of environment (e.g. is it a grid? Open space?)\nDoes your environment have properties? (e.g. resources at that location in the environment, different conditions, etc.)\nDoes your environment have actions/procedures/processes that occur? (E.g. growth of plants on blank grid spaces might be an example)\n\nBe sure to give a complete enough description that we can understand how the environment is structured, how it may change, and how it may interact with your agents (described further below).\n\n\n2) Agents\nGive a more detailed description of the “agents” in the system, addressing their properties, actions, and rules. Specifically, be sure to address:\n\nAgent properties (e.g. age, location, ID, etc.)\nAgent actions (e.g. move, consume, reproduce, die, etc.), and how these actions affect the agent, other agents, and the environment\nAgent rules: Give a brief overview of the rules which govern which actions will occur and how they depend on the agent properties (e.g. a rule might be that if there is not enough food, the agent will move to a new location in search of food). \nInteraction topology: give a description of who interacts with whom in the system. Are your agents perfectly mixed? Spatial proximity? Along a network? Cellular automata neighborhood? Are interactions only between agents, or with the environment as well?\n\nEach of the above can be (for example) a bulleted list with descriptions, or a table with descriptions, prose format, etc.\n\n\n3) Model Scheduling\nProvide a high level, step-by-step description of your schedule during each “tick” of the model (or whatever the equivalent is if you are using a different implementation of time). What does an agent, cell, etc. do on a given turn? Provide a step-by-step description of what happens on a given turn for each part of your model. This can be a good place to include the flowchart diagram mentioned above.\n\nStep 1\nStep 2\nEtc…\n\n\n\n4) Model Parameters and Initialization\nDescribe and list any global parameters you will be applying in your model.\nDescribe how your model will be initialized\n\n\n5) Assessment and Outcome Measures\n*What quantitative metrics and/or qualitative features will you use to assess your model outcomes?\nWhat analyses do you plan to run, and how will these analyses help you to address the question or goal that you started with?*\n\n\n6) Parameter Exploration\nWhat parameters are you most interested in sweeping through or sampling? What value ranges do you expect to look at for your analysis? How will this help you to answer the question or goal that you started with?",
